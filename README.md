# Git & GitHub — Knowledge Hub

This repository points to a **public, structured knowledge hub** about Git and GitHub, maintained in Notion.

The hub is designed as a **timeless reference**, focused on:
- core concepts
- essential operations
- standard workflows
- decision-making under real scenarios
- failure modes and common pitfalls
- precise technical vocabulary

It is **not** a tutorial, course, or personal study log.  
It exists to reduce cognitive load and support clear decisions when working with Git.
