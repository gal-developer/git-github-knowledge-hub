## Overview

This repository points to a **public, structured knowledge hub** about Git and GitHub, maintained in Notion.

The hub is designed as a **timeless reference**, focused on:

- Core concepts  
- Essential operations  
- Default professional workflow  
- Decision-making under real scenarios  
- Failure modes and common pitfalls  
- Precise technical vocabulary  

It is **not** a tutorial, course, or personal study log.  
It exists to reduce cognitive load and support clear decisions when working with Git.

## How to Use the Hub

- Start with **Core Concepts** if something feels unclear.
- Use **Essential Operations** for command reference.
- Consult **Default Git & GitHub Workflow** for day-to-day usage.
- Check **Decisions, Patterns, and Failure Modes** when architectural decisions are required.
- Use the **Glossary** to reinforce technical vocabulary.

Each page is intentionally small, focused, and indexable.
